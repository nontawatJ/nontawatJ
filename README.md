**Hello! I'm Nontawat but you can call me Mak. It's a pleasure to meet you.**

I'm a Computer Science Graduate who specializes in Full Stack Development.

As I have been an international student from a very young age, I have had an opportunity to experience many different cultures. 
The experience I have gained makes me an open-minded person with the ability to adapt to a new work environment.

I firmly believe that earning and maintaining trust is the key to success in both business and personal world.

You can get to know me more by looking at my personal website https://nontawatj.github.io/
